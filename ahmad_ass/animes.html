                This solutions manual may be used in conjunction with the associated quiz book, which lists short questions and answers for
                each chapter in the book. These can be used for short class tests to assess if students have read the material or
                as self-assessment tests which the students complete in their own time. Interactive travel planning system System
                with a complex user interface but which must be stable and reliable. An incremental development approach is the most
                appropriate as the system requirements will change as real user experience with the system is gained. An initial
                activity where you understand the function of the system and set out broad requirements for what the system should
                do. These should be expressed in sufficient detail that you can use them as a basis for deciding of a system/component
                satisfies some of the requirements and so can be reused
